# Radan's dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. The repo is public on the off chance someone else finds them useful and that I can easily link to a specific line. I, however, didn't bother to make them generic. If you use any part, make sure to adapt it for yourself.

## Setup

Clone into the home folder and link the files:
```sh
$ .dotfile/link
```

### Cleanup

Just unlink the files:
```sh
$ .dotfile/unlink
```
